# Drug Risk Analysis

This project investigated drug habits and drug-positive crash risk of people in the US. 
The overall goal of this analysis was to determine how drug use rates and drug-positive crash risk are related between different age groups.
The results of this analysis inform on which population of people in the US are most prone to impaired car accidents.
